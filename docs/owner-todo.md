# Owner to-do (Pujan)

Manual items only Pujan can do. Claude: at the start of a chat, mention any open item that relates to the work at hand, and tick items off here when Pujan confirms them.

## Open

- [ ] **Deploy ahromlabs.com** (`npm run deploy` in ahrom-labs): the electronics and interiors demo links, the lead emails to pujan@ahromlabs.com (contact form and all three demos) and the new event names are committed but not live until then. Until it is deployed, the contact form still emails the old CONTACT_TO address and demo lead emails fail quietly (leads are still saved).
- [ ] **Savistar live check after the Next 15 upgrade** (merged 13 Oct 2026, PR #1): once Render shows the deploy finished, open the live app and check sign-in, a client page and an invoice PDF.
- [ ] **Savistar: confirm `SESSION_SECRET` is set on Render.** `lib/auth.js` falls back to a fixed string when it's missing, which would let anyone forge a login. Once confirmed, the fallback can be removed.
- [ ] **Savistar: change any default passwords.** A brand-new database creates hari, sachi, admin and dristi with `<username>123`; if any live account still uses that, change it in Settings.
- [ ] **GA key events:** once each has been seen, star `boiler_demo_form_sent`, `electronics_demo_form_sent`, `interiors_demo_form_sent` and `contact_form_sent` under GA Admin → Events (GA only allows this after the event has arrived). `generate_lead` is no longer sent.
- [ ] **GA internal traffic:** send Claude the office IP (`curl -s https://api.ipify.org`) so the internal-traffic filter can be set up.
- [ ] **Shanti live DB test data:** decide whether to delete the "ZZ DEMO VINDHYA DAIRY PVT LTD" enquiry and customer (2 Oct) and the "ZZ-PLAN-TEST" project (30 Sep).
- [ ] **Disk space:** about 1.2 GB was free on 13 Oct 2026; local demo testing needs about 5 GB.

- [ ] **Check the demos for real names by hand** (Pujan said he will): sign in as each sample login on all three demos and look for client, partner or staff names.

## Done

- [x] Demo AI keys added (SB Ops, LS Inventory) and tested live; LS pipeline secrets added (13 Oct 2026).
- [x] Savistar merged to Next 15 + React 19 (PR #1, 13 Oct 2026); live on Render (commit b83ae09); pipeline secrets and CLIENT_URL set.
- [x] GA4 property, Measurement ID, `GA_API_SECRET`, custom dimensions, Search Console link (13 Oct 2026). See `docs/analytics-strategy.md`.
